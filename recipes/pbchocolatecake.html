        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the ultimate cake for lovers of peanut butter and chocolate!</p>
        <p>I make this recipe for my family every year at Christmas. The cake is incredibly rich and delicious, but it is not super difficult to make. I like adding chocolate shavings to the top of it.</p>
